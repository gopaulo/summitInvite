## The Summit 25 Invitation System: Development \& AI Instructions

### **Goal**

Deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly invitation system that strictly enables entry to The Summit 25 event via personal invitation, supports viral network growth through referrals, automates waitlist handling, tracks relationships for data/marketing, and maintains a premium brand experience throughout.

***

### **System Requirements**

#### **1. User Registration Flow**

- **Access Restriction:**
    - The main site (landing page) MUST NOT have an open registration form.
    - Only users who receive a unique, valid invitation code can access the registration page.
- **Invitation Entry:**
    - On the website, the primary CTA (call to action) areas should direct users to:
        - (“Enter Your Invitation Code” or
        - “Join the Waitlist”)
- **Conditional Registration:**
    - On code entry:
        - Validate the invitation code (must be unused and assigned in the backend).
        - If valid—unlock access to the registration form.
        - If invalid—deny access and prompt “Not eligible. Please request an invite.”
- **Waitlist Registration:**
    - Users who don't have a code can join a waitlist via a separate form.
    - Collect the following: Name, Company Name, Company Size, Role, Email, LinkedIn, short motivation/interest statement.
    - Store all waitlist entries securely for future review.


#### **2. Invitation Code Management**

- **Code Generation:**
    - Every confirmed attendee receives X (e.g. 5) unique invite codes post-registration.
    - Codes must be single-use, unique, and mapped to the inviter in the system (for referral tracking).
- **Distribution:**
    - On successful registration, the system sends a branded, personalized email to the new attendee containing their code(s) and instructions for inviting others.
    - Optionally allow users to copy or share code directly via dashboard.
- **Admin Portal:**
    - Admins should be able to:
        - See all registered users, mapped referrers, and code usage.
        - Adjust the number of codes per user, release batches of codes (e.g., for VIP or waitlist upgrades).
        - Export data as CSV/Excel.


#### **3. Code Validation and Tracking**

- **Referral Tree:**
    - For each new registration, log: code used, who issued the code, and timestamp.
    - Enable admin-level view of the full referral network (inviter → invitee chains).
- **Audit Trail:**
    - Each registration event must be logged (for security/compliance and marketing insight).
    - Must record user status: invited, registered, waitlist, code assigned, etc.


#### **4. Waitlist Management**

- **Automated Waitlist Handling:**
    - Allow admins to review and promote users from waitlist to eligible (manually or in batches).
    - Auto-email notified users with a unique code/invite when released from the waitlist.
- **Prioritization:**
    - Waitlist forms should collect enough data for admins to prioritize high-value candidates (e.g., business size, engagement, leadership status).
    - Recommend simple notes/tag interface for admin review.


#### **5. Automation \& Communication**

- **Email Notifications:**
    - Trigger the following emails:
        - Upon initial registration (welcome + context).
        - When user is promoted off waitlist (contains their invite code).
        - When an attendee is approved and given codes for inviting others.
        - Reminders before event with personalized links to join Restream/live event.
    - All emails should follow event branding and exclusivity messaging ("You have been selected", "You have received an invitation from [Referrer Name]", etc.).
- **Integration:**
    - Allow easy export of emails/contacts for marketing automation (e.g., Mailchimp, Hubspot, CRM).
    - Optionally, API endpoints for advanced integrations.


#### **6. Security \& Abuse Prevention**

- **Code Security:**
    - Each code can only be used once; must expire on use or after a set period.
    - Prevent code enumeration/brute force by rate-limiting and auditing failed attempts.
- **User Verification:**
    - Encourage/provide optional LinkedIn or company website verification fields for higher quality sign-ups.
    - Option for manual admin approval override in special cases.


#### **7. Branding \& Experience**

- **Customizable Messaging:**
    - All forms and emails must carry event branding, language, and exclusive tone.
- **Personalization:**
    - Codes and invite links should use the receiver's name where feasible.
    - Dashboard/confirmation should reiterate status ("You are in", "You've been given referral power", etc.).
- **Responsive Design:**
    - Make all web forms and dashboards mobile-friendly and visually aligned with The Summit 25’s premium look.


#### **8. Analytics**

- **Reporting Dashboard:**
    - Visual summary of registrations, code usage, active users, pending/waitlisted, referral performance, and event growth over time.
    - Simple export to CSV/Excel for marketing analytics.

***

### **Philosophy, Edge Cases \& Communication**

- **Position the Invite System as a Privilege:**
Make all users feel special to be in the referral network. The system should reinforce exclusivity without feeling elitist.
- **Viral Growth—but Controlled:**
Limit code quantities per user, allow for manual adjustment, and provide clear tracking of referral health to maintain the caliber of the community.
- **Communication is Key:**
Use humanized, empowering notifications (“Congratulations, you’ve been selected”) with clear next steps for both direct invitees and waitlisted applicants.

***

### **VibeCoding/AI-Specific Tips**

- As the AI/LLM ingests this, it should:
    - Auto-generate concise, branded email templates with merge fields (for names, codes, referrer).
    - Map backend logic into a modular workflow, ready for AI-driven improvements (e.g., code allocation, waitlist scoring).
    - Surface any UX friction points or admin pain points for review.
    - Suggest automations for reminder emails, re-invites, or handling unused codes.

***

### **Summary of Deliverables**

1. End-user portal: invite code validation → secure registration → attendee dashboard with invite codes.
2. Waitlist: separate form, admin review, and promotion pipeline.
3. Admin console: view users, track codes/referrals, manage waitlist, export data, adjust code rules.
4. Automated, branded communications for every journey phase.
5. Secure, branded, analytics-enabled system, supporting both front-end (UX) and back-end (admin, marketing) goals.
